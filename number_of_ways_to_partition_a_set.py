Given a set of n elements, find number of ways of partitioning it.
Examples:

Input:  n = 2
Output: Number of ways = 2
Explanation: Let the set be {1, 2}
            { {1}, {2} } 
            { {1, 2} }

Input:  n = 3
Output: Number of ways = 5
Explanation: Let the set be {1, 2, 3}
             { {1}, {2}, {3} }
             { {1}, {2, 3} }
             { {2}, {1, 3} }
             { {3}, {1, 2} }
             { {1, 2, 3} }. 


Value of S(n, k) can be defined recursively as, S(n+1, k) = k*S(n, k) + S(n, k-1)

for example, S(4, 2) = 2*S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)

because if we need to make 4 elements into 2 partitions, 
we can add 4 to every set of the partitions of 3 elements into 2 sets

and if we want to keep 4 as separate partition,
we need to consider S(3, 1) because we can have {{4}, {1,2,3}} as a 2 set partition of 4 elements

another important part..
The total no of partitions possible with 4 elements will be S(4,1)+S(4,2)+S(4,3)+S(4,4)

How does above recursive formula work?
When we add a (n+1)â€™th element to k partitions, there are two possibilities.
1) It is added as a single element set to existing partitions, i.e, S(n, k-1)
2) It is added to all sets of every partition, i.e., k*S(n, k)
